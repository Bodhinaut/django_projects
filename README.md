Currently working on learning Anaconda, using virtual environments within to run Python and Django projects.

### Django
A free and open source web framework. 
* It allows us to map a requested URL from a user to the code that is actually meant to handle it. It also allows us to create that requested HTML dynamically. 

* Templates allow us to inject calculated values and information from the _database_ into an HTML page to then show to the user.
